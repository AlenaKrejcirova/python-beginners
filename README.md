# Example repository for class materials and notes

Each subject taught in a class should come with a repository containing any class materials or teacher notes used to create and teach the class. By sharing these materials, we hope to make it easier for:
- Students to access class materials as future reference after the class is over.
- Teachers to make forks of materials from past classes for use in their own classes. Other teachers should be able to use these forks for their classes.
- Keeping track of community-maintained materials for classes the community deems important enough to be held periodically. Teachers can use these ready-made materials and lesson plans for their classes.

# Licensing

The license for all classroom materials is the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA). A common, open license allows materials to be used and improved upon in multiple classes, or by any interested parties, while being able to easily understand the license terms.
